Simple Node developer challenge.

### Goal
Clone this repo and build a simple key/value store CLI using only the core Node API. Once you have finished the challenge, please deliver it by providing a GitHub repo, Dropbox, or Google Drive link.

### Store API

`$ store list`

`$ store get mykey`

`$ store remove mykey`

### Steps for running the cli app::

1. Get into the root directory of the project and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies regarding the project.
2. To create symbolic link from your `global node_modules` directory to the local `module's` directory run `npm link`.
3. Now you are ready to run the Store API commands.
